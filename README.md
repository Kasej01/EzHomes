## EzHomes
Adds homing capabilities so that you and your friends no longer have to run back to your base after a long journey.

## How To Use

```bash
#Use the below command to set your home to your players current location
/sethome

# If you already have a home set, use the below command to teleport to it
# You must stand still for 5 seconds in order to teleport home, if you move, your teleport will be cancelled.
/home
```


## Future work
Soon, we will be adding permissions, so that server admins can decide who gets to use these commands and who does not. We will also be adding settings that can be adjusted by server admins to set multiple homes and change the time to teleport.
